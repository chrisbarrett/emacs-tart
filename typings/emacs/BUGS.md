# Emacs Typings Issues

Cross-version issues affecting multiple Emacs releases.

## type-system-gap

_Symbols requiring features tart doesn't have (dependent types, row polymorphism)._

## untypeable

_Symbols whose behavior can't be captured soundly (dynamic dispatch, eval-based)._

## ergonomic

_Symbols that are typeable but awkward (excessive annotations at call sites)._
